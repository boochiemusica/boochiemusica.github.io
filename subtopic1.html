    <h1>History</h1>
    <h3>The Birth of the Browser</h3>
    <p>The first computers, built in the 1950s, took up entire rooms and had less computational power than a simple pocket calculator. By 1969, the Department of Defence had developed ARPANET, the first functional network. In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee at CERN wrote his first proposal for the World Wide Web. The plan was to create a program that linked text documents together via a public network for the first time. By the end of the next year, he had created the first browser. However, it only functioned on NeXT computers, so the next step was to rewrite it to be used on any computer, thus birthing the line-mode browser. The bulk of this development was taken on by intern Nicola Pellow and the WWW software was released to CERN colleagues in 1991. In December of the same year, the first US server went online at Stanford. The only extant browsers were still the NeXT-exclusive and the line-mode, which wasn’t user-friendly, it was underpowered, and it could only handle text. Faced with these limitations, Berners-Lee and his small team at CERN realized they didn’t have the manpower to properly develop his invention to its full potential. He asked other developers across the world for assistance and several groups and individuals responded with browsers of their own, mostly made for X-Windows.</p>
    <h3>Leap to the Public</h3>
    <p>In 1993, Marc Andreeson of the NCSA released Mosaic, a precursor to Firefox. It ran on X-Windows, which was the most popular environment among researchers. It was free-to-use non-commercially, user-friendly, and thrust the Internet into a new era by giving anyone with access to a PC subsequent access to images, chatrooms, and webpages. In the same year, CERN went open source with the World Wide Web, allowing any developer across the globe to have a whack at creating new ways to access it and ushering in the booting up of over 500 known servers. The NCSA also released PC and Mac versions of Mosaic, further broadening the scope of internet access. Andreeson went on to found Netscape in 1994, releasing the Netscape Navigator, the first browser for the public. Thus began the so-called Browser Wars.

    <h3>The Browser Wars</h3>
    <p>In 1995, Microsoft saw an opportunity. The majority of the world operated on their Windows computers, so they created Internet Explorer, licensing the old Mosaic code and bundling it with Microsoft Plus for Windows 95. Netscape and Microsoft began to battle it out, each trying to outdo the other with better, faster versions of their respective programs. Netscape released JavaScript and Microsoft answered with CSS. Opera came out of Norway in 1995, another in the wave of browsers that overtook the late nineties and early aughts. Microsoft packaged Internet Explorer with their Windows OS and by 1999, it controlled 99% of the market share which sparked antitrust litigation. After AOL bought it in 1998, Netscape decided to open source its code and created Mozilla, which later birthed Firefox in 2002. Mac released its own browser for its machines, Safari, in 2003. When the iPhone took Mac mobile, Safari began to catch on and now holds about a quarter of the market. Google, founded in 1998, rolled out Chrome in 2008, which today controls most of the market at around 64%. Chrome offered a new innovation called “tab sandboxing” which allowed one tab to crash without crashing the entire browser. In 2012, it became cross-platform, making the jump to mobile. In 2015, Microsoft swapped Internet Explorer to the still-extant Edge.
